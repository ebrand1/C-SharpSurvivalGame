# C-SharpSurvivalGame
This repository includes several scripts written in C# for Unity that serve as a basis for a survival game/FPS.

Specifically these scripts include functionality for both first and third person views and the ability to switch between them. Please note that the gun script is not currently set up to support third person shooting. ScriptableObject classes have not yet been written. This repository is a work in progress.
